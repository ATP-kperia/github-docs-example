# Writing Good Documentation


## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, and share** code. A good __Cloud Engineer__ uses Codeblocks whenever possible because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or reasearch issues.

- In order to create codeblocks in markdown you need to use three backticks \`\`\`
- Not to be confused with single quotations \'\'\'
```
print('Hello, world!')
```
- When you can you should attempt to apply syntax highlighting to your codeblocks
```python
print('Hello, world!')
```

Make note of where the backtick character is located. It should appear below the Esc key, but it may vary based on your keyboard layout.

Good Cloud Engineers use codeblocks for both code and errors that appear in the console. 
```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/path/to/example.py", line 4, in <module>
    greet('Chad')
  File "/path/to/example.py", line 2, in greet
    print('Hello, ' + someon)
NameError: name 'someon' is not defined
```
> Here is an example of using a codeblock for an error that appears in bash.

When you can, always provide a codeblock instead of a screenshot.

If you need to take a screenshot, make sure it's not a photo from your phone

> There are certain cases where it's okay to take photos with your phone. This is when you are showing something like a keyboard, which does not appear on a computer screen
> If it is rendered on your computer screen it should be a screenshot.


## Step 2 - How to take screenshots

A screenshot is when you capture a part of your screen via your computer or phone. This is **not** to be confused with taking a photo with your phone or camera.


## Step 3 - Use GitHub Flavored Markdown Task Lists

GitHub extends Markdown to have a list where you can check off items. [^3]

- [x] Finish Step 1
- [ ] Finish Step 2
- [x] Finish Step 3


## Step 4 - Use Emojis _(optional)_

GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) supports emoji shortcodes.
Here are some examples
| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud | `:cloud:` | ‚òÅÔ∏è |
| Cloud with lightning | `:cloud_with_lightning:` | üå©Ô∏è |


## Step 5 - How to create a table

You can use the following markdown format to create tables:
```markdown
| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud | `:cloud:` | ‚òÅÔ∏è |
| Cloud with lightning | `:cloud_with_lightning:` | üå©Ô∏è |
```

Github extends the functionality of Markdown tables to provide more aligntment and table cell formatting options. [<sup>[5]</sup>](#external-references)

Make note of where the pipe character is located. It should appear below the Backspace key, but it may vary based on your keyboard layout.
